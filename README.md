# Lottery Scheduler
 
Assign each running process a slice of the processor in proportion
to the number of tickets it has. The more tickets a process has, the more it runs. Each
time slice, a randomized lottery determines the winner of the lottery; that winning
process is the one that runs for that time slice.

To run the project: copy files in folder merge_that to xv6
